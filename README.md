## Goals

Hmm, this feels weird. I've been thinking about this a lot lately though, so I probably ought to get some of that thinking out of my head to make room for other stuff. Also, it'll be good to get in the habit of documenting stuff like this. Uhh, a list I guess:

1.  This project will be a [monorepo](https://danluu.com/monorepo/) (for [all the reasons outlined by the Babel project](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md)).

    - This project will be different in that it will host packages _and_ apps using [Yarn Workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) and maybe [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/).
